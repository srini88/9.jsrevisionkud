doing advanced techniques in JS and jQuery...

HTML5 canvas draw function...
create a square logo...
silver square with a black logo


jquery dan Wahlin... great course.....Jquery fundamentals..

why use jquery?

single javascript file.... very powerful,. cross browser....amazing...I6, firefox, chrome, opera...

jquery makes it you can focus on your app... jquery can take care for you...

featuers -- selectors.....imp...
events --- imps..
very rich AJAX --- use jquery to callback to server and get JSON...
and finally plugins...very rich free jQuery plugins..

how do you locate elements with a specific class? modern browser use query 

how do you apply styles to multiple elements?

how do you handle events in a cross browser mannner?

IE 6-8   go with jQuery 1.x 

also jQuery 2.x 


why CDN?  go to a site -- and they use this URL from google...that script is cached for that domain..

you go to another domain ..it is already cached... 

microsoft and google have data centers all over the world.. get some speed benefits.. 
caching, regionality..
parallelism..

what happens if you can't get jQuery script... will cause a big problem..

provide a fall back ...

<script src ="cnd link"></script>  successful window object will have  anew property called jQuery 
<script>
window.jQuery || document.write('<script src = "jquery"></\script>');
</script>

$ = is the alias.. called once DOM hierarcy is loaded...but before all  the images have loaded.....

when it is ready ,,call the callback --- inline anonymous function..

use $(document).ready(function(){

});


////handling events...
easy and robust API -- handle different types of events in different ways..

on and off type of functions...
events can bubble up...


live delegate and on -- live and delegate are old... new api is on and off...


different tehcniques to do hover events.... 

click event --- IE 8 and earlier... 

myButton.addEventListener('click', function(){})

myButton.attachEvent ('onclick', function(){})  ...event name of the event is different......in IE8..

jQuery wraps all this pieces of functionality..... 
events notify a program that a user performed some type of action...


jQuery provides a cross-browser event model that works in IE, chrome, Opera a..




jqeury =-- click , blur, focus, dblclick, mousedown , mouseup, mouseover, keydown , keypress..





Selecting with jQuery

With jQuery, selecting things is the same as plain Javascript: it uses CSS selectors.

If you select something using plain JS, you can’t use jQuery functions without selecting it with jQuery. If you select something with jQuery, you can’t use plain JS functions.

$('#thing') — will select an element with the ID of thing
$('div') — select all the div elements on the page
$('.thang') — will select all the elements with the class of thang


If you want to apply something to all the elements you selected in jQuery, there are two ways to do it:

Directly using the collection
Using a loop

var $thePTags = $('p');

// Directly: this will apply the same CSS to all the elements
$thePTags.css('color', 'red');

// A loop
$thePTags.each(function (i) {
  // $(this) refers the current thing inside this loop
  $(this).css('color', 'red');
});

.offset
Get the current coordinates of the first element, or set the coordinates of every element, in the set of matched elements, relative to the document.
The .offset() method allows us to retrieve the current position of an element relative to the document. Contrast this with .position(), which retrieves the current position relative to the offset parent.

.offset() returns an object containing the properties top and left.


hooking up events in html is shit... dont put onclick and all that shit in html..instead do it in JS...

---------------------Testing and prototyping Javascript .----another course..




unit --small section of code.....verify the functionality...

define a test suite... could be a javascript module...


mocha is our unit test framework, expect is an assertion library...calculator.....

<script>
mocha.ignoreLeaks();
mocha.run();
</script>

put expect, put mocha, put our calculator.js, then  put our testing files..code..



---first define a calculator test suite...

describe("Calculator", function(){
	var Calculator;


	beforeEach(function(){
		calculator = new Calculator();

	})

	describe("Add", function(){
		it("should return sum of both operands", function(){
			expect(calculator.add(1,1).to.be(2))
		})

	})

})

grunt js automation node, written in JS. automates, concatenation, minification, compiling and transpiling etc..



hard to test code...

tightly coupled componemt, private parts, singletons, anonymous functins, mised concerns, new operatorrs..



singleton --- reset singleton and test...

be wary of code that mixes various different concerns...MVC ..
testing code like this can be very awkward...


problem with new ....

new Date - hard to test...



.each is an iterator that is used to iterate over only jQuery objects collection while jQuery.each ($.each) is a general function for iterating over javascript objects and arrays

$.each(dataArray, function() { });
Or, if you have a DOM jQuery object:

$(Selector).each(dataArray, function() { });


try not to tightly couple your components... use depencdency injection..

limit use of singletons, otherwise you will need to reset them..

anonymous functin - name will show up in the stack trace..


Mocha Javascript test runner...
simple tests...  

asynchronous testing... mocha is good...elegant....Getting started withGrunt, runs on Node....use grount to automatically runn tests...


Mocha testing framework...

Hooks - you can provide several hooks to run code before and after tests....set up and tear down...

before(function()) oruns one before the suite..

beforeEach  runs before each test..

afterEach = after each test
after  -- terar down for suite..


Cross - browser and node support....

mocha bdd approach..

10 unit tests --- I want to see all results of test.s..

use bail :false

mocha.setup({
	ui :bdd;
})
globals : ["jQuery"]
timeout:3000

if test takes too long ,  it will fail..

bail : false, bail on first test suite..

ignoreLeaks :true

grep : use a string or a regexp to filter tests with..


calculator - should return NaN if passed 0 arguments..


mocha bdd approach..

BDD uses a more verbose style so that it can be read almost like a sentence.

This is what I meant by saying that BDD eliminates issues that TDD might cause. The ability to read your tests like a sentence is a cognitive shift in how you will think about your tests. The argument is that if you can read your tests fluidly, you will naturally write better and more comprehensive tests.


The difference between BDD and TDD is that BDD begins with a B and TDD begins with a T. But seriously, the gotcha with TDD is that too many developers focused on the "How" when writing their unit tests, so they ended up with very brittle tests that did nothing more than confirm that the system does what it does.

BDD provides a new vocabulary and thus focus for writing a unit test. Basically it is a feature driven approach to TDD.

Exactly. There is no difference between BDD and TDD. BDD is TDD done right. TDD done right is BDD. The problem is that doing TDD right is hard, or more precisely learning how to do TDD right is hard. The reason is that TDD has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with testing, but it is hard to understand that important fact when all the terminology is about testing. So, BDD literally is just TDD with all the testing terminology replaced with behavioral examples terminology. It's like that "try not to think of a pink elephant" thing.







BDD utilizes something called a "Ubiquitous Language," a body of knowledge that can be understood by both the developer and the customer. This ubiquitous language is used to shape and develop the requirements and testing needed, at the level of the customer's understanding.




Idiom. TDD settles for tests, BDD enforces story telling format
JavaScript Examples

Unit tests in jasmine (BDD)

describe("A suite", function() {
  it("contains spec with an expectation", function() {
    expect(true).toBe(true);
  });
});
Unit tests in jsUnity (TDD)

function test_lists() { assert.areEqual([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]) }


Something not implemented yet -- it will show in pending..

apply only method to run only one test or suite...


mocha easy to do async

setTimeout
deferred
animation 
ajax


use done...

also can set timeout on a suite..

The assertions, or expectations as they are often called, are where things start to differ. Mocha does not have a built in assertion library. There are several options though for both Node and the browser: Chai, should.js, expect.js, and better-assert. A lot of developers choose Chai as their assertion library. Because none of these assertion libraries come with Mocha, this is another thing you will need to load into your test harness. Chai comes with three different assertion flavors. It has the should style, the expect style, and the assert style.


Both libraries have a similar API regarding the structure of your tests. They both allow you to write your tests using a describe block. They also both have the same approach for asynchronous testing using a callback method (done)

HTTP compression........browser can handle compressed content, server can zip it up before it sends it to the client...

content expiration- leverage  customer's browser cache ...

3) content Distribution Network...offload files to your own web server..
4) Etags-  variation of content expiration...

%) remove unnecessary http headers...



1) HTTP compression ----- send as little as possible...utilize http compression...

conding header - on the request --- 

with compression enabled....compress the particular file and send the compressed result to the client browser


by this we get about 53% less bandwidth...

now use IIS compression...

IIS7 can control when to stop using if CPU usage is too high.....
only static compression is on by default..

compress on the fly and send it out to the client --- dynamic content compression...


all css, js files will be reduced...

IIS compression...built in -- it is free....all major browsers support it...

browser can send the accepting coding header....there is no reason not to use http compression...trade off -- it uses very less percentage of the CPU..


Microsoft’s IIS is the second most popular Web server software. It consists of a series of services including File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) and others that enable a Windows machine to manage Web sites




For most people reading this, compression is enabled by adding some code to a file called .htaccess on their web host/server. This means going to the file manager (or wherever you go to add or upload files) on your webhost.

browser will say Accept-encoding:gzip ,...then server will do the necessary compression...


The browser sends a header telling the server it accepts compressed content (gzip and deflate are two compression schemes): Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate

The server sends a response if the content is actually compressed: Content-Encoding: gzip



s exciting as it may appear, HTTP Compression isn’t all fun and games. Here’s what to watch out for:

Older browsers: Yes, some browsers still may have trouble with compressed content (they say they can accept it, but really they can’t). If your site absolutely must work with Netscape 1.0 on Windows 95, you may not want to use HTTP Compression. Apache mod_deflate has some rules to avoid compression for older browsers.
Already-compressed content: Most images, music and videos are already compressed. Don’t waste time compressing them again. In fact, you probably only need to compress the “big 3” (HTML, CSS and Javascript).
CPU-load: Compressing content on-the-fly uses CPU time and saves bandwidth. Usually this is a great tradeoff given the speed of compression. There are ways to pre-compress static content and send over the compressed versions. This requires more configuration; even if it’s not possible, compressing output may still be a net win. Using CPU cycles for a faster user experience is well worth it, given the short attention spans on the web.




CONETNET EXPIRATIONS - send data infrequently as possible..

first time visit...download all of those and browser store it in local cahce...

close browser..and come after couple of days... 
ideally look in browser cache and see if it already there...and serve it...

make sure it is not dirty...
browser each file found in browser cache -- and go back to origin web server..I have this file..has this file been modified since...


if it has , it will send new content..if not ..it will send status code as 304...

	small contenet files it is just as expensive to see if modified as to receive content...

100 additional requests being made.......to the server to do the checking...


So leverage my user's browsers cache... 

setup expiration times for conent folders...


avoid requests for files that seldomd change -- .js, .css and image files...indicate to the client that these files are look for certain period of time...

images are good for 30 days,,this image put in 20 days ago...

broser will check expiration date...if expires --- browser will request server..and get new page...

if not...browser ill ask and get 304 response...

	Cache control :  max-age setting ...... 365 days...



2nd way...CDN network...


///providing fallback..
<script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.2.6/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script>if (!window.jQuery) { document.write('<script src="/path/to/your/jquery"><\/script>'); }
</script>


having CDN is 73% faster than my own servers...

ETags= mechanism to support caching for browsers....normal mechanism --- ask if has been modified or not --- is too fragile...


Etags -- used for cache  validation... 
IIS sends the ETag header in response for static files......
hash:changeNumber...



remoeve unnecessary HTTP header...there will be etag header...remove that...

X powered by  : ASP.net...remove that shit...


HTTP compression is built into IIS and can greatly reduce the amout of data sent to the client...

expirations leverage the user's browsers cache , return visitors get bulk of files locatllly with no load on the  web servers..

CDNs offload work from the web server and are much closer to our users...

------------------FRONT END performance....

External CSS and Javascript....
CSS and JavaScript mification and Consolidation...
Image Optimization...make them smaller...

CSS sprites --- 
Favicon.ico caching... set this up to take advantage of cacheing...

almost always put CSS and JS in external files... 


Able to use expirations.....leveraging user's browser;s  cache..

Minification and Consolidation..

JSMin, packer...YUI compressor....CSSMin...

take care of this minification at build time...not at the run time..


mechanism to reference new combined files..

do image optimzation.. jpegtran -- removes unnecessary metadata, lossless....  visual quality will exactly be the same...

Smush.it png optimization..



Favicon.ico caching....by defaut, most browsers automatically look for this file in root folder of site..... use for favorites, address bar..

setup to use an image with expirations..

others performance improvements..

Data and output acching... ajax, web forms , performance analysis tools, 




We could also listen to other events, like key presses:

$('html').on('keydown', function (e) {
  // The number representing the key that was pressed
  console.log(e.keyCode);
});

https://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/topics/dom/#event-propagation
Event propagation

Events follow a propagation in Javascript that includes the capture phase: starting at the <html> element and working down the children until it hits the element; then the bubbling phase that goes backwards up the parents of the element. On each element in the capturing and bubbling phase an event is fired.

$('a').on('click', function (e) {
  // Will stop the element from doing what it normally does
  e.preventDefault();
  // Will stop the event bubbling back up through its parents
  e.stopImmediatePropagation();
});
Using e.preventDefault() on <a> tags will stop the browser from navigating to another page.


Event delegation

Sometimes we need to capture events on elements that don’t exist yet, or when there’s lots and lots of elements where binding listeners to all of them would be a performance issue.

For this we can use event delegation.

With this HTML we can bind our event to the <ul> itself, but then only listen for events that fire on the <li> elements.

$('.dinos').on('click', 'li', function () {
  // Notice the `li` above indicating the delegated element
});

var btn = document.querySelector('.btn');

// Add a class with `add()`
btn.classList.add('js-highlight');
// Remove a class with `remove()`
btn.classList.remove('js-highlight');
// Toggle a class on/off with `toggle()`
btn.classList.toggle('js-highlight');
// Check to see if the element has a class
btn.classList.contains('js-highlight');

var $dinos = $('.dinos');
var $first = $('.first');

// Add after all the current list items
$dinos.append('<li>Tyrannosaurus</li>');
// Add before all the current list items
$dinos.prepend('<li>Iguanodon</li>');


Form submission event

The first thing to do when dealing with forms is to capture the form’s submission event and prevent it from doing what it normally does.

<form class="form" method="post" action="capture-data.html">

</form>
var $form = $('.form');

$form.on('submit', function (e) {
  // Stop the form from doing what it normally does
  e.preventDefault();
});


Simple values

For simple inputs like: text, number, color, date, time, url, email, etc. we can just use jQuery’s val() function.

var $email = $('.email');

// Will get the information the user typed into the input field
$email.val();
§Checkboxes

For checkboxes we need to confirm whether or not the item is checked, like this:

var $terms = $('.terms');

$terms.is(':checked'); // true or false
§Radio buttons

For radio buttons we need to grab them by their group name then find the one that has been checked, getting it’s value.

<input type="radio" id="meat" name="diet" value="Meat" checked>
<input type="radio" id="plant" name="diet" value="Plant">
$('[name="diet"]:checked').val(); // Meat
It’s important that radio buttons include the value attribute when working with them.

§Select elements

Select elements work like basic text inputs, but must be set up differently, specifically all the option elements need value attributes.

<select class="dinos">
  <option value="stego">Stegosaurus</option>
  <option value="trex" selected>Tyrannosaurus</option>
  <option value="pterano">Pteranodon</option>
<
/select>
$('.dinos').val(); // trex



Targeting multiple elements at once

If you’d like to style more than one element the same way you can use a comma to separate the tag names.

/* Target the <h1> tags, the <h2> tags, and the <h3> tags */
h1, h2, h3 {
	color: white;
}

/* Would select every <p> tag inside a <header> tag */
header p {

}

/* Target every <p> tag, inside a <div> tag, that is inside a <header> tag */
header div p {

}






/* Would select every <p> tag inside a <header> tag */
header p {

}

/* Target every <p> tag, inside a <div> tag, that is inside a <header> tag */
header div p {

}


/* Target every <p> tag, inside a <div> tag, that is inside a <header> tag */
header div p {

}

The child selector allows a little more precision, looking at the HTML above, say we wanted to get just the p tags outside the div.

Using the > symbol—the child selector—we select only direct children of another tag.

/* Target a <p> tags that is directly inside a <header> tag */
header > p {

}

This wouldn’t select the other p tag because it’s also inside a div.

If we only want to get the p tag immediately after the h1 we can use the adjacent selector, a + symbol.

/* Target every <p> tag that is immediately beside an <h1> */
h1 + p {

}

<h2 class="veloci dino">Brachisaurus</h2>
Now the h2 element has both the veloci class and the dino class. The reason we can’t have a space in our class names is because the space is used to separate multiple classes on the same element.


Styling by number

We can also style elements based on their location and number: whether they’re first, last, odd, even, etc.

<ul>
  <li>Dimetrodon</li>
  <li>Pterasaur</li>
  <li>Mammoth</li>
  <li>Sabertooth Tiger</li>
  <li>Humans</li>
</ul>
We can select different li elements based on their position in the unordered list.

/* Target every <li> tag that is the first element inside a <ul> */
/* Dimetrodon */
ul li:first-child {}

/* Target every <li> tag that is the last element inside a <ul> */
/* Humans */
ul li:last-child {}

/* Target every even numbered <li> tag inside a <ul> */
/* Pterasaur, Sabertooth Tiger */
ul li:nth-child(even) {}

/* Target every odd numbered <li> tag inside a <ul> */
/* Dimetrodon, Mammoth, Humans */
ul li:nth-child(odd) {}

/* Target the 4th <li> tag inside a <ul> */
/* Sabertooth Tiger */
ul li:nth-child(4) {}





There is a CSS selector, really a pseudo-selector, called nth-child. Here is an example of using it:

ul li:nth-child(3n+3) {  
  color: #ccc;
}

 nth-child accepts two keywords in that spot: even and odd. Those should be pretty obvious. "Even" selects even numbered elements, like the 2nd, 4th, 6th, etc. "Odd" selects odd numbered elements, like 1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.

As seen in the first example, nth-child also accepts expressions in between those parentheses. The simplest possible expression? Just a number. If you put simply a number in the parentheses, it will match only that number element. For example, here is how to select only the 5th element:

ul li:nth-child(5) {  
  color: #ccc;
}

The hexadecimal system has sixteen digits to work with: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, a, b, c, d, e, f—0 is the smallest and f is the largest.

When there are 3 pairs of numbers, like #ffffff, or #ccff00 we can simplify the hex code.

#ffffff becomes #fff
#ccff00 becomes #cf0
#000000 becomes #000

The RGB colour system is similar to hex, just specified a different way. Also, it has the ability to have semi-transparent colours, which the hex system does not.

You can specify the red, green, and blue component of the colour:

h1 {
	color: rgb(0, 0, 0); /* Black */
	color: rgb(255, 255, 255); /* White */


	RGB semi-transparency

The best thing about the RGB system is that some colours can be specified with semi-transparency by adding another number.

h1 {
	background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); /* 50% transparent black */
	background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.75); /* 75% opaque red */
}


Space — Descendant
Select an element that’s a descendant of another element.
ul li {}
nav a {}
ul li {}


> — Child
Select an element directly inside another element.
ul > li {}
h1 > span {}
footer > .copyright {}


+ — Adjacent sibling
Select an element immediately beside another element.
h1 + p {}
hr + p {}
li + li {}

[] — Attribute
Select an element by it’s attribute.
Good for styling links differently if they’re external.
[data-state="active"] {}
[href^="http" {}
[download] {}

:first-child
Select the element when it’s the first inside its parent.
p:first-child {}
ul li:first-child {}
.person:first-child {}


:nth-child()
Select an element by it’s number.
Good for zebra-striping table rows.
li:nth-child(2) {}
tr:nth-child(odd) {}
div:nth-child(5n) {}


:nth-last-child()
Select an element by it’s number, counting backwards from the end.
/* Third from the bottom */
li:nth-last-child(3) {}

:disabled
Select an element when its disabled attribute is set.
button:disabled {}



:checked
Select an <input> when its checked attribute is set.
input:checked {}







:link
For styling a link that hasn’t been visited.
a:link {
  color: #4484c2;
}

:visited
For styling a link that has been visited.
a:visited {
  color: #ccc;
}

:hover
For styling an element when the mouse hovers over it.
a:hover {
  color: #00f;
}

For styling an element for when the keyboard focuses it.
Only works on <a>, <button>, and form inputs by default.
button:focus {
  outline: 3px solid #000;
  outline-offset: 2px;
}

:active
For styling an element when the mouse button is clicked down on it.
a:active {
  color: #f33;
}


Transparency
The transparent keyword can be used to remove a colour.
background-color: transparent;


Change the typeface of the text.
Put quotes around typefaces with spaces in their names.
Always provide a fallback typeface.
Web safe fonts: Georgia, Arial, Verdana, Times, Comic Sans, Courier.
font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif;


font-size
Change the size of the text.
Prefer rem or em units.
font-size: 1.5rem;





font-weight
Change the thickness of the text.
bold, normal, number: 400, 700, etc.
font-weight: bold;



font-style
Change the slanting of the text.
italic, normal
font-style: italic;

line-height
Adjust the space a line takes up, similar to leading.
Set in a number, a multiplier of the font size.
line-height: 1.4;

text-align
Adjust the position of the text within its parent.
left, right, center, justify
text-align: center;

text-decoration
Add or remove lines on the text.
none, underline, line-through, overline
text-decoration: none;


A box with no content isn’t visible, so content is the first layer
Outside content is the padding, pushing the edge of the box away from the content
Outside the padding is the border, the background colour stops here
Outside the box is the margin, a transparent layer pushing other boxes away

The margin and padding properties are used to put space around your box, either outside the box or inside the box.

margin — adds spacing outside of the box, pushing other boxes away
padding — adds spacing inside the box, pushing the content away from the border; the background colour is visible within the padding

div {
	/* Will push other boxes 10 pixels away on all 4 sides */
	margin: 10px;
	/* Will push the content away from the box edge on all 4 sides */
	padding: 12px;
}

Since boxes have four sides, there are four different margins and paddings that can be changed.

For margin, we have margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, margin-left.
For padding, we have padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, padding-left.

div {
	/* margin: top right bottom left; */
	margin: 10px 12px 8px 6px;
}

For the order, we start at the top of the box and make our way clockwise around the box.
