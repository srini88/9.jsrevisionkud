// The change event occurs when the value of an element has been changed (only works on <input>, <textarea> and <select> elements).

// The change() method triggers the change event, or attaches a function to run when a change event occurs.

// Note: For select menus, the change event occurs when an option is selected. For text fields or text areas, the change event occurs when the field loses focus, after the content has been changed.
